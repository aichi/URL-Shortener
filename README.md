# URL Shortener #

I made URL Shortener because I want own URL shortener for CZECHDESIGN.CZ site with click statistics. It used bit.ly API to hold statistics, but this Shortener use own database, so it is possible to switch to another provider as easy as implement new URL shortener provider API.

I also prepare PHP/JS administration. In this version you should create new link and list all links. It is prepare for logging to this administration.
